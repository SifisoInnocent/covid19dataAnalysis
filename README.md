# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

## Project Description  
This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data. It explores trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries, presenting key insights through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Objectives  
- Load and clean COVID-19 dataset using pandas  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize trends in new cases and vaccination coverage  
- Calculate critical indicators such as Case Fatality Rate (CFR)  
- Present findings in a clear, reproducible Jupyter Notebook report  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis-python.git`  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   `cd covid19-data-analysis-python`  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   `jupyter notebook covid19_data_analysis.ipynb`  
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Insights  
- Different countries have experienced varying trends in COVID-19 case counts and vaccination rollout speeds.  
- Vaccination coverage varies significantly and correlates with changes in case numbers and deaths.  
- The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) provides a critical measure of pandemic impact across regions.
